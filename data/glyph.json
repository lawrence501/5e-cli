You can create a trap in a maximum of 1 minute. When you lay a trap, decide whether you want to hold the victim in place (a snare) or inflict damage (a deadfall). Next, attempt a Sleight of Hand check with DC 9 (for a snare) or a DC equal to 1.5 times the number of points of damage you want to inflict (for a deadfall). For example, if you want to inflict 8 points of damage, that is a DC of 12. The resulting damage also adds your level. On a success, you create your trap, which has a detection, disarm, and escape DC of 9. If you are proficient in Stealth or Deception, this DC increases to 12. If you have any expertise dice, it increases to 15.",

To do so is a two-step process, and calling the spirit is potentially the easiest step. First, you summon a spirit. You must have personally known the spirit when it was a living creature, or you must have an object that was owned by the spirit when it was a living creature and know the spirit's full name, or you must touch the physical remains of the creature. The spirit must be the essence of something that once lived in the Material Plane, and be free to join you. If the spirit responds, it can manifest as an insubstantial shade that answers for itself, if can inhabit an object or any remains you provide, or it can manifest as an invisible presence that you speak for. The spirit may not wish to answer your questions; the second step is persuading or convincing the spirit to help. The spirit only has knowledge it possessed in life.",

The spirit must remain within 5' of you - if it moves further away, it fades away at the end of your following turn and cannot return until you take a long rest. The spirit accomplice exists partially out of phase (allowing it to move through walls). The spirit takes up residence in an object you designate, and it manifests as either an invisible presence or a ghostly shade. Your spirit accomplice has double proficiency in 1 knowledge skill the DM determines. The spirit is normally insubstantial, but you may spend a bonus action once per minute to make it corporeal and allow it to act as a combat creature. While corporeal, the spirit cannot move through objects or fly. A spirit remains corporeal for up to 10 minutes at a time, but fades back to being insubstantial if not actively engaged. If your spirit accomplice is destroyed, it reforms in 1d6 days, or you can attract a new spirit in 2d6 days.",

While the wraith cloak is active, you have advantage on Stealth checks.",

The raised spirit persists for up to 1 day (or less, if it accomplishes something important to it before then), after which the spirit fades away and cannot be returned again. The raised spirit remembers everything it knew in life and possesses its previous powers (though not necessarily its equipment). In addition, it gains the ability to become insubstantial as a bonus action for up to 1 minute at a time. The raised spirit is not beholden to you, and it does not need to remain near you to remain manifest.",

A portion of its soul energy infuses you, and you regain 1d6 hit points. Then the spirit is ferried to a special cell hidden in the afterlife. Only you know where the spirit is located, which means the spirit cannot be questioned, raised, or restored to life by any means unless you allow it.",
