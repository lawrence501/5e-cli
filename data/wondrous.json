As an action, you can loudly snap a high-resolution, full-color photograph with this camera. It comes with an alchemical light bulb for flash photography, which the item’s magic replenishes after a minute. This is not a subtle process, due to the loud sounds of the machinery within that imprint the image into the crystalog. This camera uses no plates. Rather, by concentrating on the crystalog you can see with your mind’s eye the images it has taken. It can store up to eight images at a time. Over the course of 1 hour, which can be performed as part of a short rest, you can magically transfer and ink a photograph onto a suitably large sheet of paper, canvas, or similar surface. The input can also be copied into an asomatous canvas projector. If a light cantrip is targeted on the crystalog, that washes out the existing images, clearing it to take more pictures after one minute. Though expensive and loud, these cameras are finding immense interest among the fields of entertainment, journalism, crime scene investigation, and espionage."

Asomatous canvas projectors have become popular across Lanjyr for civic color, theatrical entertainment, animated artwork and advertisements, and more. While the figment sheds light, it is nowhere as luminous as that of arctech everbright lamps and actual electric incandescent filament bulbs. Some talented artists have experimented with sets of multiple cubes intended to be played in sequence, creating an animated and audible story in five-minute segments; these exhibits have been called kinetograms. By touching the cube as an action and thinking upon a desired figment (or transferring an image from an alacritous camera), the user can set the cube to memorize the figment and then project it when the desired conditions are met, just as if casting a programmed illusion spell. The common wall projector can produce a 5-foot cube of image out to a range of 10 feet, while the uncommon stage projector can fill a 30-foot cube out to a range of 120 feet. This functions in many respects as a programmed illusion. However, the figment lasts indefinitely, sheds light as bright as a torch, and has a distinctly washed out, somewhat grainy and flickering character (similar to what we’d recognize as early silent films) that makes it completely obvious to even a common lizard that it’s an illusion. Since anyone can adjust the cube’s programming, asomatous canvas projectors are normally kept under literal lock and key, often in bronze filigreed boxes with a gap just large enough to allow the invisible strands of illusory magic to pour through. Unsurprisingly, these cubes are prime targets for pranksters and protestors."

When they were first mass produced in 517 aov, incarceration reformists breathed collective sighs of relief as the need for stringent and often cruel countermagical security features was greatly reduced. Engraved runes and mystical geometries create Example Planarite—Earth One basic earth planarite is adamant, a dark rock that can be worked into metal to create adamantine. Urim is most renowned for its gold, but meteoric astrium is a metal infused with earth and space energy, which floats in tandem with other metal at distances from a quarter inch to up to a yard, allowing for novel gear patterns that won’t collide as easily. planar conduits to Urim, selected for its enhancement of the metaphysical concept of barriers. Urim’s planar energies pour into the steel, reinforcing it under certain conditions. Normally, these act as nothing more than regular manacles. If placed upon either a willing creature, or a creature at 0 hit points, a soft and aureate light begins to limn the handcuffs, signifying that they have been magically reinforced until the next time they are removed. While so magically reinforced, all DCs associated with circumventing the manacles increase to 30. Additionally, whenever the wearer uses any non-permanent magical effects (including but not limited to spells, charming gazes, frightening auras, invisibility, shapechanging, telepathy, teleportation, the Incorporeal Movement trait, legendary actions, or lair actions), they take 4d6 psychic damage and must make a Constitution saving throw or else the magic they attempted fails to happen. Similar to concentration, the DC is 10 or half the damage the wearer takes, whichever is higher. If someone attempts to break the cuffs, the wielder takes damage as if they tried to use magic. The cuffs have 30 hit points, and either resistance or immunity to most types of damage. The cuffs’ damage is nonlethal, and cannot kill the wearer. The cuffs, however, only have three charges each hour, so a very committed prisoner might manage to power through an escape attempt. For the most magically powerful foes, greater bindings that use similar principles might be employed. The uncommon ‘magebinding jacket’ deals 10d6 psychic damage to a wearer who uses magic, and also keeps them restrained. It too only has three charges per hour, but as yet no prisoner has ever been known to fight past more than two. Courtesy of Urim’s aureate energy, the jacket has 50 hit points. Some devoted incarceration facilities have countermagic cells, which function as magebinding jackets for anyone inside, but have no limit to the number of charges."

            "description": "This delicate arrangement of arctech clockwork gears of rusted iron is assembled from the reflection of real-world metals found in the Bleak Gate. Its gears constantly, silently spin despite their corrosion. While the charm is on your person and you are on the Waking or in the Dreaming, as a bonus action, you can mentally will this charm to irreparably break itself apart. After a screech of rusted iron, the gears shatter and slice open planar fabrics like a can opener. This functions as a plane shift spell for the Bleak Gate, except that this magic affects only you, and you arrive in the exact spot that is an analog for your current location. When you enter the Bleak Gate, the magic of the charm continues to resonate in your mind and soul for the next 10 minutes. At any point during this time, as a bonus action, you can focus on the fleeting remnant of magic and return to the plane where you used this charm, appearing in a spot analogous to your current location. Rare versions of this charm are contingent. When you finish a short or long rest with the charm on your person, you can define or redefine a circumstance which triggers the charm. The charm breaks itself apart immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether you want it to or not. This functions as the conventional activation above, and indeed, you can still break the charm normally if necessary."

Such attacks gain all of the benefits of using magic weapons."

            "description": "A person’s past can bring many benefits: connections, knowledge, insights. This arcanotechnological hourglass’s array of glyph-engraved gears ensure that it always rotates in such a way as to keep accurate track of time by the minute. Its sands are filled with relicite planarite from Teykfa and a drop of witchoil, and they let the bearer briefly call forth a version of themselves that might have been. As an action, you can activate this geared hourglass, causing it to oscillate rapidly. You think of a background, such as criminal or folk hero. You temporarily acquire some benefits of that background other than ability score increases. For instance, you might gain a proficiency, a criminal connection or the local fame of a folk hero. You specify the broad strokes, but the Narrator fills in any finer details. You keep your original real background, but also exist somehow simultaneously as this other version of yourself. This benefit lasts until you sleep. If you desire, this may also slightly alter your appearance, matching your new background. You’re still identifiable as you, but might acquire a scar or remove one, change hairstyle or become slightly more attractive. You are instinctively aware of the alterations that were necessary to complete this change, and they are usually unobtrusive. You acquire nothing else; for instance, gaining the noble’s background does not give you any more wealth or properties than you originally had. However, people are subtly affected by this alternate reality and will treat you in keeping with your new background. After this action, the hourglass’s clockwork screeches to a halt, but returns to its normal function at the start of the next new moon. After an aggressive campaign by an alliance of arcanoscience scholars of Pardwight University, folk skyseers, Beran philosophers, and Drakran economists, the nations of Risur, Ber, and Drakr all banned this device, warning of perilous consequences. However, followers of the Clergy – especially Ottoplismists – see it as an ideal representation of perfecting oneself, albeit temporarily. Elsewhere they are seen as curiosities only."

The sphere can be carried in your palm, or it can be left to float at any location, invisible except to those who know to look for it. Each orb is attuned to up to five tokens, which usually take the form of metal or wooden feathers. While holding one of these tokens, you can cast sending without components to one or more creatures carrying another token, as long as both you and your recipients are within thirty miles of the orb. The message takes time to be delivered, carried by an unseen breeze that travels at twenty miles an hour. The recipient can choose to send a reply, which also takes time to fly back.

Any creature with incorporeal movement or on the Ethereal Plane (visible or not) that passes in front of the camera’s open aperture (up to 30 feet away) will trigger the camera to immediately take a monochrome picture. This has no effect on creatures affected by an invisibility spell. You can also take a picture manually as a reaction. Once a picture is taken, you must spend an action to prepare the camera for another. Unlike physical objects, incorporeal beings do not need to stay still to appear on the resulting photo, though the entire process takes 1 minute to complete. Such photos do not need to be developed and show ghostly subjects in crisp detail, while all mundane aspects (chairs, corporeal creatures, etc.) are at best mildly blurry. Each picture taken with a spectral camera costs 2 gp in materials, which are significantly rarer than those for a mundane photograph. (300 gp, 15 lbs.)"

            "description": "Adamant and aether are wrought into a two-inch-diameter arctech disc reminiscent of a carriage’s wheel. The wealthy and the powerful use this bauble for intracity transportation when they worry of bullets flying from dangerous streets. As an action, you can throw this disc onto the ground. It instantaneously and spectacularly assembles itself into a horseless carriage of darkwood, steel plate armor, magically hardened glass windows, and fine leather upholstery. Some versions of this figurine build complex arcanotechnological wheels, while others construct mechanical equine legs, which are just as effective. The carriage can accommodate up to nine Medium passengers inside. While its windows are closed, creatures entirely inside the carriage have total cover. Outside of a combat encounter, the carriage can travel at up to 20 miles per hour, though the general lack of paved roadways outside of cities limits its range. The carriage navigates autonomously; it stops or swerves to avoid hazards, and follows simple telepathic directions. One creature in the driver’s seat can use its action to manually direct the carriage, or to make it attack. The carriage appears at full hit points and acts as a Huge animated object with AC 18, but will not attack unless directed by a driver. If no creatures or foreign objects are inside the carriage, any creature can use an action to touch the carriage and transform it back into a disc."

Encased within is a tiny quantity of blood, a living icon of the titaness and a conduit of her power, however humble. While you are wearing the pendant: * Arachnids default to being friendly to you unless given a reason to feel otherwise. * While in contact with a web, you know the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web. * As a bonus action, you can extrude and detach from your wrist a thick web strand that functions as a rope of climbing. If you use this bonus action again, the previous rope disappears. * Librarians presume you and those you travel with have permission to access library facilities, even subscription libraries, as long as you’re not disruptive. * You know the exact distance, direction, name, and rough description of the nearest library, be it public, subscription, or even ruined and abandoned. * Additionally, during a long rest, you can meditate on objects or locations in your vicinity. You drift into sleep and dream, and when you awake you recall vivid visions about history. You can choose from the two following options up to eight times during each long rest. * You learn how an object’s owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the past week, you can select this option again to learn the same information about that creature. * You see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back up to a week. For each time you select this option, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation."

While the charm is on your person and you are on the Waking or in the Dreaming, as a bonus action, you can mentally will this charm to irreparably break itself apart. After a screech of rusted iron, the gears shatter and slice open planar fabrics like a can opener. This functions as a plane shift spell for the Bleak Gate, except that this magic affects only you, and you arrive in the exact spot that is an analog for your current location. When you enter the Bleak Gate, the magic of the charm continues to resonate in your mind and soul for the next 10 minutes. At any point during this time, as a bonus action, you can focus on the fleeting remnant of magic and return to the plane where you used this charm, appearing in a spot analogous to your current location. Rare versions of this charm are contingent. When you finish a short or long rest with the charm on your person, you can define or redefine a circumstance which triggers the charm. The charm breaks itself apart immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether you want it to or not. This functions as the conventional activation above, and indeed, you can still break the charm normally if necessary."

You can use the bike to fly for 2 hours, expending at least 10 minutes worth of time with each use. If you are flying when the time runs out, you fall at a rate of 60 feet and take no damage from landing. The bell regains 1 hour of flying time for every 12 hours it is not in use, regardless of which form it is in. CURSE: While far from malicious, the magic of the bell is exuberant to a fault.

As an action, you can teleport any number of your severed body parts back onto your body if they are within three miles. Any clothing, armor, and accessories are detached or reattached with the limbs. * During your turn, if you are not incapacitated and both of your arms are severed, they are entitled to their own movement. Both of your arms function as a single unit, and they have a sympathetic link to you. For most mechanical purposes, you occupy both your actual space and the Tiny space of the arms. Your arms typically have the same AC as you, and only your arms benefit from a shield. You and your arms share temporary effects, and your arms have a fly (hover) speed equal to your highest speed.

You can use an action to play the violin and immediately cast control weather or banishment (save DC 18), neither needing components. To maintain concentration on either spell cast this way, you must continue playing the violin with both hands without releasing it. You can still cast another spell as long as it requires no material components, weaving the somatic and verbal components into your performance.

            "description": "This arcanotechnological lantern of adamantine and bulletproof glass is a smaller refinement of the first design of a wayfarer’s engine, which inspired all manner of planarite alchemy. The lantern’s arcanotechnological stabilizers allow you to hang it on your hip. The lantern functions as a regular lantern, but it sheds bright light out to 15 feet and dim light out to 30 feet. As a bonus action, you can use one hand to manipulate the lantern in one of the following ways: * Push a button to adjust a shutter over the lantern. This can cause it to shed light in all directions (bright to 15 feet, dim to 30 feet), to function as a bullseye lantern (bright in a 60-foot cone, dim another 60 feet), or to block all light. While the lantern’s magical effects normally go through obstacles, the lantern’s shutter does block or aim the light’s effect. * Push a button to set the lantern to indiscriminate mode, glyph-only mode, or no-glyph-only mode. * Draw a writing implement and use it to scribe a glyph onto a small sketching surface embedded atop the lantern. As an action, you can use one hand to draw one ounce of planarite worth 25 gp that has been processed into oil form (such as unensouled witchoil), pour it into the lantern’s special reservoir, and then push a button to activate the lantern’s most powerful function. The lantern immediately burns up the planarite, and you choose one of the following: * Using Dreaming or Bleak Gate planarite, you form a link to that plane. The oil burns for up to five minutes, during which time the brightly-lit area overlaps with an equivalent space on the destination plane. Each creature that is illuminated by the lamp gradually transitions to the destination plane, seeing the original plane become less solid as the destination becomes more real. Once a creature has spent at least 1 continuous minute in the illuminated area, it fully transitions, and it receives no saving throw to resist this. * The lantern burns for five minutes, and creatures and objects undergo a magical effect based on the planarite’s plane for as long as they are in the area. Certain combinations of planarite might produce particularly exotic effects. Depending on the lantern’s settings, this can affect either all creatures in the path of the light, creatures carrying a specific glyph, or creatures not carrying a specific glyph. If it affects only creatures carrying a specific glyph, while this planar light shines, only those creatures can see the lantern and its illumination. The effect varies based on the source of the planarite oil. ] The Dreaming: Vibrant, varicolored incandescence distorts memories. When the five minutes of light end, creatures that were in the light at any point must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature forgets everything it had witnessed while within the light. ] The Bleak Gate: Like the “sun” of the Bleak Gate, this is not so much light as it is an eerie-looking devouring of darkness. If a creature that has a shadow or is made of darkness ends its turn in the light, the creature spawns a shadow that single-mindedly attacks the creature. The shadow lacks Sunlight Weakness, and has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. The shadow cannot exist outside of the radius of the lantern’s light, and disappears once the five minutes of oil finishes burning. Once a creature has spawned a shadow this way, it cannot spawn another shadow from the same lantern for 5 minutes. ] Vona, the Sun: Helical rays expose all that is true and suppress invisibility and illusion. Creatures and objects in the light can be observed by viewers, even viewers outside of the light, as if the viewers had true seeing with indefinite range. This light does not count as true sunlight. ] Caeloon, the Paper Wind: Soothing green shine grants hope in the hour of need. If a creature is actively participating in combat and at half of its hit points (rounded up) or fewer, it can gain a powerful d10 expertise die on one roll. After doing so, it cannot gain the benefit again for five minutes. ] Urim, the Shattered Golden Chain: An aureate glow enforces a stalwart barrier of inertia. Creatures cannot teleport into, out of, or within the light. Creatures must spend twice as much movement as they otherwise would in order to move into, out of, or within the light. ] Jiese, the Fires of Industry: Red lantern flame bolsters cunning in all forms. Creatures gain an expertise die (1d4) on Intelligence, Wisdom, Deception, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks. ] Ostea, the Beating Heart: Blood-red brilliance bolsters vitality. Creatures have advantage on Constitution saving throws, and they cannot fail death saving throws. When damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the creature can choose to go to 1 hit point; once a creature avails of this, it cannot do so again from the same lantern for 5 minutes. ] Av, the Planes of Dreams and Reflections: Pale, white refulgence grants ingress into dreamscapes. As an action, a creature can cause themselves to fall asleep, and then cast their mind into the dreamscape of a naturally-slumbering creature also within the light. This journey only lasts so long as the lantern light glow, and the nature of the dreamscape is up to the Narrator. A creature that “dies” in the dreamscape wakes up; they suffer a level of strife, but all the damage they suffered in the dreamscape goes away unless it was psychic damage. If the dreamer awakens, those inside the dreamscape “die” this same way. ] Amrou, the Salt Waste: Pallid light transmutes subjects into pillars of salt. If a creature ends its turn in the light, it must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be petrified while it remains in the light. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. Once a creature succeeds on this saving throw, it is immune to the same effect from the same lantern for 5 minutes. ] Iratha Ket, the Graveyard Revel: Bone-white refulgence inspires subjects to perform and dance. Creatures gain an expertise die (d4) on Performance checks. If a creature sings, its lyrics, however contrived, can be universally understood by any creature with a language, even if the listener is outside of the light. Creatures never provoke opportunity attacks, as they dance out of the way. ] Mavisha, the Mysterious Deep: An ocean-blue glow disrupts divinations and shrouds subjects. Creatures are under the effects of mind blank and nondetection. As an action, a creature can magically turn invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell); any equipment the creature wears or carries is invisible with it. This protection, however, feels like being deep underwater, and when the five minutes end, any creature that spent at least one round in it gains one level of fatigue. ] Ascetia, the Hidden Jungle: Lush green illumination brings history to the fore. Each creature can touch another creature’s head and share a vivid memory one time during the five minutes of light. ] Teykfa, the Ticking Pendulum: A dun radiance grants an awareness of time, yet physically stretches out the seconds. Creatures know the exact time of day, down to the second. A creature that ends its turn in the light must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the effects of slow while it remains in the light. Once a creature succeeds on this saving throw, it is immune to the same effect from the same lantern for 5 minutes. Once the lantern has consumed planarite this way, it takes 8 hours for the light’s energy to fully fade. Buring planarite oil from a different plane during this time produces no magical effect."

            "description": "Not to be mistaken for a simple spectral camera, this plain-looking but obviously finely-made piece gives off a subtle but reassuring feeling of peace. As an action, you can use one charge to focus the camera’s lens on a single creature within 30 feet and take its picture. If the targeted creature is an undead or a fiend, it must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or be instantly captured in a glass photographic plate. If the target is not an undead or fiendish creature the charge is wasted. Any other creatures shown in the photograph are unaffected, even if they are undead or fiends. The spirit-trapping camera can produce as many plates as it has charges, though each must be removed as a bonus action before you can use another charge. A trapped creature can be released by breaking the plate or it can be sent to its final judgment (in the case of an undead creature) or back to its native plane (in the case of a fiend) by immersing the plate in holy water for 1 hour, at which point it disappears. Creatures banished in this way cannot return to the plane they were sent away from for a year and a day by any means short of divine intervention. If neither of these actions are performed within 24 hours of the photograph being taken, the creature is banished as above, though it has no limitations on returning. The spirit-trapping camera has 3 charges and regains 1 each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, it becomes a mundane photochemical camera (see Adventures in ZEITGEIST or a5e.tools)."

            "description": "This knot of fey spider silk unfolds into a ten-foot square, occasionally unearthing a long-dead sparrow or a cricket that waves thanks before hopping away. This web functions similar to a portable hole, and can contain material that would fit in a 10-ft. cube. However, the user cannot see what is in the extradimensional space, and can only extract things they know are inside. Those attempting to divine the contents of the web via magic must succeed on a DC 28 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a failure, the spell or effect is wasted, and the creature cannot attempt to divinatorily discover the contents of the web again until 24 hours have passed. A creature placed into the extradimensional space is placed into stasis for up to a month, needing neither food nor water, but still healing at a natural pace. If a living creature is not freed within a month, the creature is shunted from the absurdist web and appears beneath a large spider web 1d6 miles away. Food, drink, and unintelligent creatures placed in the web are consumed immediately by unseen entities, but dead sapient creatures are left alone and do not decay for up to one month. After that point, whatever etiquette fey spiders abide by treats them as fair game, and they are quickly devoured. Moving the web does not count as moving the body for the normal limit of three miles on resurrections and speaking with spirits. Word has it that this web has a profound connection to the Webway, a series of space-folding tunnels crafted and frequently used by the arachnids of the Dreaming. The new fey titan known as the Hollow Widow would doubtlessly know more of these webs and the Webway."

            "name": "Hope's Final Light",
            "description": "This fine silver hooded lantern is lite with an everburning light that emanates no heat and burns a pale blue. With its filtered hood down in the dark, it projects strange shadows on nearby walls which dance like those of a zoetrope, depicting stories of heroic triumph against all odds. Holding it lifts your spirits. When you find this lantern, roll 2d6-2. The result is its current charges. While carrying it, you can increase its current charges by sacrificing some of your own vitality. For each charge you add, your maximum hit dice are reduced by 1 and your current hit dice are reduced by the same amount. The lantern can only hold a maximum of 10 charges at a time. If an effect would cause the lantern to expend more charges than it currently has, you immediately provide charges to meet the need. If you do not have enough hit dice to meet the cost, the effect fails. If the lantern has 6 or more charges, the radius of its bright light is doubled. If the lantern has 0 charges, it sheds no light. Charges can be expended in the following ways using your reaction (unless otherwise noted): 1. Creatures of your choice in the lantern's bright light can use their reaction to spend 1 charge to add 1d12 to a d20 after it's rolled. You can use your own reaction to disallow this use; 2. When a creature in the lantern's bright light is reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend 1 or more charges to roll 1d12 per charge expended. The creature is conscious with hit points equal to the result; 3. When a creature in the lantern's bright light takes damage, you can project a shield over them. The damage is negated, and the lantern loses 1 charge per 10 damage negated (minimum 1); 4. When a creature in the lantern's bright light is targeted by a spell or would be caught in the area of a spell, you can negate the spell's effect on that creature. The lantern loses charges equal to the spell's level. If Hope's Final Light is missing any charges at the end of a long rest, roll 1d8. On a 1, nothing happens. Otherwise, it regains all lost charges. [CURSE] Hope's Final Light is a dangerous burden. If you have 0 hit dice remaining after providing charges to it, you are pulled into the lantern and are impossible to resurrect except by the direct intervention of a deity. The stories of creatures who vanish in this way are depicted in the shadows it casts."
