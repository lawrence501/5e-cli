## Condition definitions

### Confused

A confused creature cannot take reactions.

On its turn, a confused creature rolls a d8 to determine what it does:
1-4. Debilitated until the end of its turn.
5-6. Dazed until the end of its turn.
7+. Makes a melee weapon attack against a randomly-determined creature at the start of its turn as a free action.

### Dazed

Shares condition immunity with incapacitation.

A dazed creature has disadvantage with Offence and Defence.

### Debilitated

Shares condition immunity with stun.

A debilitated creature suffers the following effects:
- Disadvantage with damaging Offence.
- All damage dealt is halved.
- Cannot take bonus actions or reactions.
- Does not grant disadvantage to adjacent ranged attackers.

### Dominated

Shares condition immunity with charm.

A dominated creature is charmed. Additionally, the dominated creature gains a free action at the start of each of its turns that can be taken to both move up to its speed and make either a single weapon attack or cast a cantrip. This free action is completely controlled by the creature that dominated the victim.

### Frightened

As before, but instead of removing a creature's ability to move towards the source of their fear, they become debilitated until the end of their turn when doing so.

### Rattled

Shares condition immunity with frighten.

A rattled creature cannot benefit from expertise dice and cannot take reactions.

### Sluggish

Shares condition immunity with exhaustion.

A sluggish creature reduces the number of attacks it can make with its Attack action by 1 (or Multiattack, where relevant).

### Staggered

Shares condition immunity with paralysis.

A staggered creature suffers the following effects:
- Incoming attack damage is always critical.
- Disadvantage with damaging Defence.

### Taunted

Shares condition immunity with charmed.

A taunted creature must target at least their taunter with all offensive actions.

## Terminology

### Splash Damage

Splash damage is always optional. It deals its damage, up to the amount of the original hit, to all creatures of your choice within 5' of the target.

## Revisited Combat Maneuvers

### Cavalier Stance

While riding your mount, your AC increases by 1.

## Ideas for next campaign/things to discuss

- Drop the Looking for Trouble journey activity, force all players to always choose at least 1 journey activity per day, and make the DC for them a static 18. This allows other journey activities to become possible as your character levels up, as you may not always be able to use your primary activity when the weather, etc. is bad for it.
    - Because of redistributing the negatives from weather, even a standardly-maxed activity should drop below 50% success (+5 ability, +5 prof at L13, -4 from weather results in +6 bonus, which is 45% success chance)
    - All players MUST take at least 1 skill prof for their highest ability on char creation
    - All journey activities score a sub fail on a roll of 2.

- Augment system - some sort of experience and gain on breakpoints? Have class feature-esque boosts in the pool, and maybe stuff that adds synergy between backstory pairs. Every 50xp?

- Split group into 2? Less mechanical, simpler loot + other systems in new group? Just conversation, no logistics or plans.

- Future loot options suggestion (d100 roll)
1. Wondrous Items (low)
2. Tomes (high)
3. Rings (med)
4. Amulets (med)
5. Shrines (med)
6. Dream Mirrors (very high)
7. Glyphs (very high)
8. Relics (high)
9. Tarots (high)
10. Crystals (low)
11. Magic Items (low)
 
8% each, remaining goes to reroll w/ upgrade (11%) + choose w/ upgrade (1% max)
