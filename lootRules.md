# Loot Rules

## Colour tiers (phenomena)

Loot rolls can have a colour tier (regular loot rolls are uncoloured), which follow the following progression:
1. Green
2. Amber
3. Red
4. Black
5. White

All loot roll results have empowered results based on their colour tier, such as gold being increased by 50% per tier, or enchanted items having 1 additional upgrade point distributed across their affixes.

## Shrines (artifacts of Gawdian)

Shrines are crafting tools. They lose all their power when moved, and so must be used as soon as they are found. For most shrines, you must choose the item to place on the shrine and receive its effect before you find out what the effect is, but some don't specify this and you can learn its effect before choosing an item to place on it. If you don't want the effect that a shrine promises, you can choose to instead not take it, which means that the shrine does nothing, but you gain 1gp.     vbvg v

## Crystals (monstrous treasures)

Crystals are socketable items that go inside any body armour. Each looted crystal has a creature type, and a random power chosen from a random CR 1 monster of that type. Occassionally while you have a crystal socketed, your crystal will flare and use its contained power. When this power is used, it counts as being used by a minion (though whenever it references itself, it affects you instead) and can be used from any unoccupied space within 60' of you. If you combine two crystals with the same creature type together, the higher CR one of them increases by 1 CR, and rerolls its contained power with that of a monster of the new CR. Additionally, you can sacrifice 2 crystals to receive a new crystal with a creature type that neither of the original 2 had.

## Magic Equipment (equipment)

Magic equipment can be of any equipment slot you want (weapon, shield, helmet, body armour, gloves, or boots). It has either 1, 2, or 3 affixes on it, and those affixes each have a minimum point value of 3, 2, and 1, respectively.

## Rings (atifacts of Mother)

Rings start off with a random unique affix. This affix is based on the ring's stone and defines its personality. You can feed a ring to another to upgrade the remaining one which unlocks your choice of one of two new affixes based on that ring's personality. Rings can be upgraded up to 4 times, and on the final upgrade they will receive a specific capstone affix based on their personality. Up to 8 rings may be worn.

## Amulets (artifacts of P'all)

Amulets are unique magic items that belong to one of several sets. By combining two amulets from the same set, you choose one of them to consume the other, unlocking the relevant "ally bonus" of the remaining amulet. You can do this multiple times on the same amulet to grant it multiple ally bonuses.

## Tomes (texts)

Tomes contain upgrades that you can apply to specific powers. Each tome specifies which sort of powers they can upgrade, and how they modify those powers. Each power can only be upgraded once. Anything your character can do as any type of action (standard, bonus, reaction, etc.), or part of an action (eg. each of the attacks in a fighter's Attack action counts as a separate power, each of which can have its own upgrade.), counts as a power. Tomes don't always provide the exact values for their upgrades; these will have their numbers based on the power that you upgrade (stronger powers will have more powerful upgrades).

## Tarot Cards (artifacts of Aroshi)

Whenever you loot tarot cards, you draw 2 cards from the deck. The party can perform a Reading by turning in 3 tarot cards, which will create a new tarot-crafted item. All tarot-crafted items are of an equipment slot of the party's choice (weapon, shield, helmet, body armour, gloves, or boots) and have a random base affix. Each card will add a unique upgrade to the item.

## Relics (equipment of legends)

Relics are equipment that can be levelled up with gold. Each relic starts at level 1, and can be levelled up 5 times (up to level 6). Each level costs 100gp. Whenever a relic is levelled up, the owner has 3 options of how to upgrade it, or can choose to apply none of the upgrades. Upgrades can either be to upgrade an existing affix on the relic, add a new random affix to the relic, or add a new thematic affix to the relic (each relic has its own set of thematic affixes). Any relic can be taken to a Diviner in any city to learn (for free) the options for the first two levels the relic will gain, and all of the thematic affixes the relic has. When relics are sold, all gold invested in them will be refunded 100%.

## Dream Mirrors (artifacts of Somnius)

Dream mirrors have different effects based on how many you have found.

Every odd mirror you find (1st, 3rd, etc.) will allow you to choose a feature from your class/subclass, a feat you have, your race, or one of your spells or maneuvers as inspiration. 3 affixes will then be generated, themed around the inspiration you chose, and added to your Dream Pool. Additionally, a random Dream you have will be chosen, and you can either upgrade it or replace it with a new affix from your Dream Pool.

Every even mirror you find will grant you a Dream, which is a permanent affix on your character, chosen from your Dream Pool. The minimum point value of this Dream is equal to the number of Dreams you now have.

## Glyphs (artifacts of Mensis)

You can only hold one glyph at a time in your inventory. If you attempt to hold more, they will all automatically be consumed. When you have no Glyph Path and consume a glyph, you will be shown the first tier of 3 random Glyph Paths. You can make Religion checks to learn more about each option. You then choose a Glyph Path to embark on. Further glyphs consumed will grant you additional tiers from that Glyph Path. Each Path has 10 tiers, after which you can start a new Path.
